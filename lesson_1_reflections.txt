How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was easier to see the diff without manually going through all the files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can access your old changes and compare it with new ones.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros of manually creating comit
    1. your commit will be logical
    2. it wont have two much irrelevant commits
    3. Flexibility

   	Cons
   	1. freedom from saving manually
   	2. it will contain all the commit no matter how small or big
   	3.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    This is done to keep track of the repository ie. upadating the rep.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	git log is used to view all commit in file
	git diff is used to check the difference between two files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    This can make you more confident since you can view and work on all the 
    previous state of your file.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Manipulate my own codes.
